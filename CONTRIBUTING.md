# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Oration.

Oration is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Oration itself.
As Oration is still pre 0.1, there are no channels other than the issue tracker setup for communication. If you have a support question, please file an issue with the tracker.
This may change as Oration grows.

# Responsibilities

* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [Rust Community Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html).
* External services such as Gravatar need to be considered by the community before inclusion. Even then, they should be completely optional.

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Oration? You can start by looking through the tracker and assign yourself to any issue that currently do not have an assignee.
Issues labeled Help wanted in particular.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email &#116;&#105;&#109;&#064;&#110;&#101;&#111;&#112;&#104;&#105;&#108;&#117;&#115;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116; instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email.

----

When filing an issue, make sure to answer/consider these five questions:

1. Have you updated to the latest rust nightly?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Oration aims to be a fast, lightweight and secure. External resources such as Gravatar therefore remain a matter of contention.
With that being said, if you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Oration, you are probably not alone.
There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Oration has today have been added because our users saw the need.
Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
The community will decide on its adoption and how to best implement it.

# Code review process

For the moment, Libbum will review your PR's whenever there is available time. Feel free to give him a prod if needed.
